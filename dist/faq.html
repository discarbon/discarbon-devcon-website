An attendee may compensate their emissions by contributing to the Devcon VI "Community Offset Pool" by sending funds to the pooling contract that match their emissions estimate. </p> <p> These funds are gathered in NCT, an on-chain token. Each token represents 1 tonne of carbon. In a second step, to be performed shortly after Devcon VI, the collected NCT will be redeemed for a carbon offset project and redeemed, "offsetting" or "compensating" emissions caused by Devcon VI. </p><p> </p></div> </div> <div class="bg-base-100 border border-base-300 collapse rounded-box"> <input type="checkbox"> <div class="collapse-title font-medium text-xl"> What does clicking the Send button do? </div> <div class="collapse-content"> <p> The Send button initiates an on-chain transaction.

This is an established model which has been found to be one of the best ones in terms of accuracy (<a class="link text-green-700" href="https://unipub.uni-graz.at/obvugrhs/download/pdf/246073?originalFilename=true">see page 86 in the linked report</a>, only available in German). A more detailed comparison between different estimation models and their accuracy can be <a class="link text-green-700" href="https://hackmd.io/@haurog/BJ0dT-g35">found in our recent post</a>. </p> </div> </div> <div class="bg-base-100 border border-base-300 collapse rounded-box"> <input type="checkbox"> <div class="collapse-title font-medium text-xl"> Why does my travel class affect my flight's carbon emissions? </div> <div class="collapse-content"> <p>The flight class directly influences the space a single passenger has available for themselves. This means fewer people can fit on a plane the more higher class seating is available. Therefore, the flight emission is divided through fewer passengers, in turn increasing the carbon emission per passenger. In addition higher class tickets have a larger baggage allowance and more elaborate meals. </p> </div> </div> <div class="bg-base-100 border border-base-300 collapse rounded-box"> <input type="checkbox"> <div class="collapse-title font-medium text-xl"> Why is the calculated carbon emission different for each flight offset calculator? </div> <div class="collapse-content"> <p>To calculate the carbon emission, <a class="link text-green-700" href="https://hackmd.io/@haurog/BJ0dT-g35">a lot of assumptions need to be made.</a> Some influencing factors are the weather, the airplane type, the seat occupancy, cargo load, emission from the airport infrastructure, carbon emission from jet fuel production. A critical part of any emission model is to also consider non-CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Our model considers them. Many other estimators with lower calculated emissions do not. Most of the above mentioned factors cannot be known for a specific flight and therefore need to be calculated from general number of average emissions of the flight industry. As our approach is to make it as simple as possible for the user to offset their emission, we do not provide such a user configurable flight emission estimator, but focus on the typical emission for a certain flight distance. </p> <p>If a more detailed analysis is desired, <a class="link text-green-700" href="https://www.atmosfair.de/de/">atmosfair</a> is a very detailed and accurate estimation tool. The calculated carbon emission can then be manually filled in the disCarbon flight offsetter and be offset on chain. <a class="link text-green-700" href="https://www.google.com/flights/">Google flights</a> is a popular choice but unfortunately we cannot recommend it for emission offsetting as <a class="link text-green-700" href="https://hackmd.io/@haurog/BJ0dT-g35">they underestimate the climate impact of a flight.</a> </p> </div> </div> <div class="bg-base-100 border border-base-300 collapse rounded-box"> <input type="checkbox"> <div class="collapse-title font-medium text-xl"> Who is disCarbon? </div> <div class="collapse-content"> <p>disCarbon are danceratopz and haurog. Our goal is to accelerate the adoption of on-chain carbon credits. The existing off-chain carbon market is opaque, illiquid and benefits middlemen as apposed to the underlying carbon offset projects that positively impact our planet. A liquid on-chain market allows carbon offset projects to manage their own carbon credits, enabling them to obtain market prices when required. Our hope is that this leads to the faster creation of high quality carbon offset projects. </p> </div> </div> <div class="bg-base-100 border border-base-300 collapse rounded-box"> <input type="checkbox"> <div class="collapse-title font-medium text-xl"> How can I support your work/disCarbon? </div> <div class="collapse-content"> <p>The best way to support us is by following <a class="link text-green-700" href="https://twitter.com/discarbon_earth">@discarbon_earth</a> on Twitter and by using and sharing our tools!
